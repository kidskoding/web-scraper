# TODO: Build a Full Web Scraper in Rust

## 1. Make an HTTP Request
- [x] Fetch the target webpage.
- [x] Handle possible errors (timeouts, invalid URLs, etc.).
- [x] Implement retries or rate limiting if necessary.

## 2. Parse the HTML
- [ ] Load the response into `scraper::Html`.
- [ ] Select and extract the required data using CSS selectors.
- [ ] Convert extracted elements into usable Rust types.

## 4. Handle Pagination (If Needed)
- [ ] Identify pagination structure (e.g., next page links, infinite scroll).
- [ ] Implement navigation through multiple pages.

## 5. Store/Process the Data
- [ ] Save extracted data to a file (CSV, JSON, or database).
- [ ] Process or analyze data as needed.

## 6. Enhance Scraper
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging.
- [ ] Add support for scraping JavaScript-rendered pages (e.g., use `headless_chrome`).
- [ ] Respect `robots.txt` and avoid getting blocked (user-agent headers, delays, proxies).

## 7. Test and Optimize
- [ ] Test with different websites.
- [ ] Optimize performance (e.g., async scraping, concurrent requests).
- [ ] Ensure compliance with legal and ethical web scraping practices.
